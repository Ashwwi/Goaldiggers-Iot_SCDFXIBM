# Fire Detection

Fire occurs everywhere in the world. Fires can have massive impact on the environment if not taken care of swiftly. Our SCDF officers risk their lives saving others and putting out threats like huge fires. As such, our group wanted to make their lives easier. Early detection of fires can be key in protecting our officers. If fires are detected earlier, the SCDF officers are given more time to prepare and equip themselves with the proper gear. This allows them to be better suited at undertaking the task at hand.

Technologies are able to play a big part in fire detection. Machines are faster than the average human reaction thus utilizing that speed can be beneficial in detecting fires. Our group decided to equip devices capable of detecting fires at many locations. The sipeed m1 module is used as our device as it was compact and able to achieve our goals.

## Training the device

Our device will be fitted with a machine learning model that is able to detect fires. This is important as we would like to make it fully automated to not activate more precious emergency resources.
