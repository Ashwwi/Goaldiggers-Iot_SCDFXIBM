## Short description

### What's the problem?

Fire occurs everywhere in the world. Fires can have massive impact on the environment if not taken care of swiftly. (Needs work)

### How can technology help?

Technology can play a big part in fire detection. Machines are faster than the average human reaction thus utilizing that speed can be beneficial in detecting fires. (Needs work)

### The idea

Detection is key in eliminating the threat of a huge fire. Thus, we decided to create a machine learning model that is able to detect fires. The model is able to identify when a fire has started and broadcast this critical information to the authoratives in a matter of seconds. 

## Pitch video

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](image here)

1. Fire is detected by the device?
2. Device broadcast this information to IBM Watson
3. Notification is send to authoratives
4. (Should we add that residents can get notfication as well idk)

## Long description

[More detail is available here](DESCRIPTION.md)

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```bash
dnf install wget
wget http://www.example.com/install.sh
bash install.sh
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be, for example

```bash
export TOKEN="fffd0923aa667c617a62f5A_fake_token754a2ad06cc9903543f1e85"
export EMAIL="jane@example.com"
dnf install npm
node samplefile.js
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

And repeat

```bash
curl localhost:3000
Thanks for looking at Code-and-Response!
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you were using something like `mocha` for instnance

```bash
npm install mocha --save-dev
vi test/test.js
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you chose `eslint` for example

```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
npx eslint --init
npx eslint sample-file.js
```
